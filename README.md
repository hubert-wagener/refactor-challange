# Spring-MVC/-Boot/-Security and REST CodingChallenge

## Origin
This coding challenge is based on [Vedenin/RestAndSpringMVC-CodingChallenge](https://github.com/Vedenin/RestAndSpringMVC-CodingChallenge)

A lot of concepts could be explored through coding like
- Spring MVC
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- Spring Rest Service
- Rest Client
- Thymeleaf
- Testing (Unit, Component) and Mocking

The original challenge included, among other things:

- develop a protected currency converter application using a public currency converter API
(https://openexchangerates.org/signup/free, https://currencylayer.com/documentation, etc... ). The application

- provide a login/registration screen and a main screen to query historical or current exchange rates. After the successful login the application should show the last 10 queries and their results on the main screen as reminder.

- Some main currencies (EUR, USD, GBP, NZD, AUD, JPY, HUF, etc...) are enough.

- Create a Java web app. 
- ...

## Possible fields of improvement
- Discuss @Inject + @Autowired
- Change to constructor dependency injection
- Nicer ways of URL building
- Usage of another http client
- Discuss storage of access key
- Reduce code duplication  
- Discussing Spring Security  
- get rid of explicit programmed getter/setter in data container classes
- Run the application in a docker container
